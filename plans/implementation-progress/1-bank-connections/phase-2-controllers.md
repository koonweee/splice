## Progress
**Started**: 2025-06-20
**Completed**: 2025-06-20

### Completed
- [x] Created BankRegistryController with public /banks/available endpoint
- [x] Created BankConnectionController with full CRUD API
- [x] Implemented JWT-based authorization with user validation
- [x] Created BankRegistryModule and BankConnectionsModule
- [x] Updated app.module.ts to include new modules and entities
- [x] Fixed build issues with splice-api dependencies

### API Endpoints Implemented
- `GET /banks/available` - List all active banks from registry
- `GET /users/{uuid}/banks` - Get user's connected banks
- `POST /users/{uuid}/banks` - Add new bank connection
- `PUT /users/{uuid}/banks/{connectionId}` - Update bank connection
- `DELETE /users/{uuid}/banks/{connectionId}` - Remove bank connection
- `GET /users/{uuid}/banks/{connectionId}/status` - Check connection status

### Notes
- Uses existing JWT authentication patterns from AuthGuard
- Enforces user-scoped access with validateUserAccess method
- Controllers transform entities to proper API response types
- All endpoints properly secured and validated
