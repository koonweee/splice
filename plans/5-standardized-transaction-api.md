# Feature Plan: Standardized Transaction API

## Overview
Create a comprehensive, standardized API layer for accessing aggregated financial data. Provides unified transaction access, account information, and analytical capabilities while serving cached data for optimal performance.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Unified transaction format across all data sources
- [ ] Rich query capabilities (date ranges, categories, amounts, accounts)
- [ ] Pagination and sorting for large transaction sets
- [ ] Account balance and summary information
- [ ] Transaction categorization and tagging
- [ ] Data export in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)
- [ ] Real-time balance updates vs historical transaction data
- [ ] Transaction search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Spending analytics and insights

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] API response times under 100ms for cached data
- [ ] Support for 10k+ transactions per user query
- [ ] 99.9% API availability
- [ ] Rate limiting per user/API key
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Backward compatible API versioning

## Technical Design

### Architecture
Builds a comprehensive read API layer on top of the stored transaction data. Implements caching strategies, query optimization, and data aggregation services. Maintains separation between data collection (write) and data access (read) concerns.

### Components
- **Services**: TransactionQueryService, AccountSummaryService, AnalyticsService
- **Controllers**: TransactionsController (enhanced), AccountsController, AnalyticsController
- **DTOs**: StandardizedTransactionDto, AccountSummaryDto, TransactionQueryDto
- **Modules**: TransactionApiModule, AnalyticsModule
- **Utilities**: TransactionFilterBuilder, DataExportService

### Database Changes
- **New entities**:
  - `TransactionCategory` (spending categories)
  - `TransactionTag` (user-defined tags)
  - `AccountSummary` (cached account metrics)
- **Views**: Optimized database views for common queries
- **Indexes**: Performance indexes for transaction queries

### API Changes
- **Enhanced endpoints**:
  - `GET /transactions` - Advanced transaction querying with filters
  - `GET /transactions/{id}` - Individual transaction details
  - `GET /transactions/export` - Export transactions in various formats
  - `GET /accounts` - Account list with balances and metadata
  - `GET /accounts/{id}/summary` - Detailed account summary
  - `GET /analytics/spending` - Spending analysis and trends
  - `GET /analytics/categories` - Category-based insights
  - `POST /transactions/{id}/categorize` - Manual transaction categorization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Transaction API
- [ ] Create standardized transaction DTOs and response formats
- [ ] Implement TransactionQueryService with filtering and pagination
- [ ] Build enhanced TransactionsController with advanced querying
- [ ] Add transaction search capabilities

### Phase 2: Account Management API
- [ ] Create AccountSummaryService for balance and metadata
- [ ] Implement AccountsController with summary endpoints
- [ ] Add account-specific transaction filtering
- [ ] Build account comparison and analysis features

### Phase 3: Analytics & Insights
- [ ] Implement AnalyticsService for spending analysis
- [ ] Create AnalyticsController with trend and category endpoints
- [ ] Add transaction categorization system
- [ ] Build spending insights and recommendations

### Phase 4: Export & Documentation
- [ ] Create DataExportService for multiple formats
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation with examples
- [ ] Implement API versioning strategy
- [ ] Add rate limiting and usage analytics

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for all service methods and query builders
- [ ] Integration tests for complete API workflows
- [ ] Performance tests for large dataset queries
- [ ] E2E tests for user scenarios and data exports
- [ ] API contract tests to ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Load tests for concurrent user access

## Dependencies
- **Scheduled Data Collection** (provides the data to serve)
- **Bank Connection System** (for user context and permissions)
- Database optimization and caching infrastructure
- Export libraries for PDF/CSV generation
- API documentation tools (Swagger/OpenAPI)

## Risks & Considerations
- **Query Performance**: Complex filters on large datasets may be slow
- **Data Freshness**: Balancing real-time needs vs cached performance
- **API Complexity**: Rich querying capabilities may overwhelm simple use cases
- **Export Limits**: Large data exports may impact system performance
- **Privacy**: Ensuring users only access their own financial data
- **Categorization Accuracy**: Automated categorization may require manual correction

## Timeline
**Estimated**: 2-3 weeks

## Questions & Decisions
- [ ] Should we implement GraphQL alongside REST for flexible querying?
- [ ] What's the optimal caching strategy for frequently accessed data?
- [ ] How to handle real-time balance updates vs batch transaction data?
- [ ] Should we provide webhook notifications for new transactions?
- [ ] What level of transaction PII should be included in API responses?
- [ ] How to handle API versioning when adding new data source fields?
